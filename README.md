# Indoor-Localization-Wearable
This project was developed for educational purposes as a project work in sbe403a Medical Electronics Systems(SBME department, faculty of engineering, Cairo University).
## Methodology
The used approach in the development of this system was based on collecting wifi RSSI data (Received signal strength indication) at different locations to train and select the best machine learning model that can be used to classify or predict the location of an esp32-based wearable device.
